Yudi Wang, yuw043@ucsd.edu


## Abstract

Nowadays young people in China feel that music contains traditional chinese element are super attractive. In this project, I'll use the GANSynth algorithm to generate melody containning the favor of traditional chinese based on the chinese country music. First we will use python scrapy package to grasp the midi dataset we need, then we will try three method: 1)use CNN+LSTM; 2)Use GANSynth; 3) Use wavegan; to generate music.
